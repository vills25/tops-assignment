# Why Django should be used for web-development? Explain how you can create a project in Django?

'''
Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. Here are some reasons why Django should be used for web-development:

Django follows the "Batteries included" philosophy and provides almost everything developers might want to do "out of the box".
Django can be used to build almost any type of website and can work with any client-side framework.
Django helps developers avoid many common security mistakes by providing a framework that has been engineered to protect the website automatically.
Django enables protection against many vulnerabilities by default, including SQL injection, cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery and clickjacking.
Django uses a component-based "shared-nothing" architecture which means that it can scale for increased traffic by adding hardware at any level.
Django code is written using design principles and patterns that encourage the creation of maintainable and reusable code.
Django is written in Python, which runs on many platforms and is well-supported by many web hosting providers.
