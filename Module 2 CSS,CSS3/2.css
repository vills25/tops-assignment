Disadvantages of CSS
The advantages of CSS are now known to us. Let us now comprehend the disadvantages of CSS that the developers need to keep in mind.

1. Cross-Browser Issues
One of the major disadvantages of CSS is its cross-browser problem. Before making the websites live, tests are conducted to check their 
compatibility. Although everyone nowadays prefers the most popular browsers like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, or Safari etc., there might be a 
few exceptions. If these tests are not performed, it might result in an unexpected performance on that particular browser.

2. Learning Curve
Although CSS is an easy language to learn, some of its syntax is quite complicated. There are also different levels of CSS like CSS1, CSS2, and CSS3.
They are different from each other in a few aspects. This can create confusion among the learners. Also, as developers, one might have to switch 
from one level to the other depending upon the requirements of the project.

3. Complex Layouts
If there is a complex layout, it might be difficult to create the same using CSS. There can be several intricacies that might arise due to the 
position and responsiveness.

4. Over Specificity
Over Specificity is an issue in CSS where the selectors are defined as having a lot of levels. In the case of nested selectors or over-specified 
selectors, the code is not quite readable and it is difficult to make changes.

5. File Size
If the web page and its styling are very large, it can hamper the performance of the website. A large sized file can degrade the loading time of the
website.
