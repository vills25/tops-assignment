/* Which property controls the image scroll in the background?

The background-attachment controls whether an element's background image scrolls with the rest of the page or remains fixed in place. 
It can take one of two values:

scroll: This is the default value, and it means that the background image will scroll along with the rest of the page as the user scrolls.
fixed:  This value means that the background image will remain fixed in place, even as the user scrolls. This can create a parallax effect, 
        where the background image appears to move more slowly than the foreground content.

So, the background-attachment property is set to scroll, which means that the background image for the 
affected element will scroll along with the rest of the page.
