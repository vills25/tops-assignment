/*  Why should background and color be used as separate properties? 

In CSS (Cascading Style Sheets background and color are separate properties that serve different purposes when it styling elements on a
webpage.

The background property is to set the background an element, which can include an image, color, or gradient. It can also be used to set 
other background-related properties such as background-repeat, background-position, and background-size.

On the other hand, the color property is used to set the text color of an element. This is important for ensuring that the text is legible
against the background.

While it would be possible to combine the background and color properties into a single property, keeping them separate provides greater 
flexibility and control over the styling of an element. For example, a designer might want to use a light text color on a dark background 
for headings, but a dark text color on a light background for body copy. By keeping these properties separate, they can be styled 
independently of each other.
