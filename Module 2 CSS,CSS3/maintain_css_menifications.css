/*  How to maintain the CSS specifications? 

Maintaining CSS specifications involves keeping the stylesheets organized, consistent, and up-to-date. Here are some best practices for 
maintaining CSS:

Use a CSS methodology: Following a CSS methodology such as BEM, SMACSS, or OOCSS can help you write modular, reusable, and maintainable 
code.

Keep it simple: Avoid using overly complex selectors and keep your CSS rules as simple as possible.

Use comments: Include comments in your CSS to explain what each section does and how it fits into the overall design.

Use a preprocessor: CSS preprocessors like Sass, Less, or Stylus can help you write more maintainable code by allowing you to use variables, 
functions, and other programming constructs.

Use a linter: A linter can help you enforce consistent coding styles and catch errors before they become problems.

Keep it organized: Organize your CSS files into logical sections, such as by component or page.
Use a version control system: Using a version control system like Git can help you track changes to your CSS and collaborate with other 
developers.

Test your CSS: Make sure your CSS looks and works as expected in all target browsers and devices.


Keep up-to-date: Stay up-to-date with the latest CSS specifications and best practices to ensure your code is modern and performant.

Document your CSS: Document your CSS codebase to help other developers understand how it works and how to maintain it.
