How can the background color of an element be changed? 

<style>
  p {
    background-color: lightblue;
  }
</style>

<p>This paragraph has a light blue background.</p>
In this example, the background-color property is set to lightblue for all <p> elements, so the background of every paragraph in the HTML 
document will be light blue.
