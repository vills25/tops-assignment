/* What are the advantages and disadvantages of using external style sheets?

Advantages of using external style sheets

Reusability: External style sheets can be linked to multiple HTML documents, allowing you to apply the same styles to multiple pages, 
             promoting consistency and reducing redundancy.
Separation of concerns: By separating the presentation (CSS) from the structure (HTML), it becomes easier to maintain and update the 
                        appearance of a website without modifying the HTML markup directly.
Efficiency: External style sheets are cached by web browsers, which can improve page loading times, especially for websites with multiple 
            pages that share the same styles.
Collaboration: External style sheets make it easier for teams to collaborate on web development projects, as designers can work on the 
               visual aspects (CSS) independently from developers working on the HTML markup.
               Disadvantages of using external style sheets:

Learning curve: For beginners, learning CSS and understanding how to create and link external style sheets can be an additional hurdle.
Overhead: Creating and maintaining a separate file for styles can introduce some overhead compared to inline styles or internal style 
          sheets, but the benefits usually outweigh the costs.
