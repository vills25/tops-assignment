/* What are the ways to integrate CSS as a web page? 

In HTML, there are three ways to integrate CSS into a web page:

Inline CSS: This is when CSS rules are applied directly to individual HTML elements using the "style" attribute. This is not a recommended
approach as it can lead to code that is difficult to maintain and scale.

Internal CSS: This is when CSS rules are defined within the "style" element in the "head" section of an HTML document. This approach is 
useful when the CSS rules are specific to a single page.

External CSS: This is when CSS rules are defined in an external .css file and linked to the HTML document using the "link" element in the 
"head" section. This is the recommended approach as it promotes code reusability, separation of concerns, and easier maintenance.
