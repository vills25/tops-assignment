/*  How to center block elements using CSS1?

In CSS1, there is no direct way to center a block element within its parent container using only one CSS property. However, there are a few methods to achieve this using a combination of CSS properties. Here's an example of one such method:

HTML:

<div class="parent">
  <div class="child">Centered block element</div>
</div>

CSS:

.parent {
  width: 100%;
  text-align: center;
}

.child {
  display: inline-block;
  text-align: left;
}
