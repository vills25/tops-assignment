/* What is the use of the background-position property? 

The background-position in CSS is used to specify the starting position of a background image within an element. The property takes one or
two values, which can be specified as length values (e.g.10pxor50%), keywords (e.g. left, center, or right`), or a combination of both.

In the given code, the background-position property is set to 50% 50%. This means that the background image will be centered both 
horizontally and vertically within the element. The first value (50%) specifies the horizontal position, and the second value (also 50%) 
specifies the vertical position.

In the given code, background-position: 50% 50%;, the background image will be centered both horizontally and vertically within the element.
The first value (50%) specifies the horizontal position, and the second value (50%) specifies the vertical position.

So, the purpose of the background-position property in this code is to center the background image within the element.

Here is an example of how this code might be used:

.element {
  width: 300px;
  height: 200px;
  background-image: url('path/to/image.jpg');
  background-position: 50% 50%;
}

In this example, the background-image property is used to specify the image to be used as the background. The background-position property 
is then used to center the background image within the .element div.
