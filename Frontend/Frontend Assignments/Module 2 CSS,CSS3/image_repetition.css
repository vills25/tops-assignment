/* How can image repetition of the backup be controlled?

In CSS, you can control the repetition of a background image using the background-repeat property. The background-repeat can take the following values:

repeat: The image is repeated both horizontally and vertically (this is the default value).
repeat-x: The image is repeated only horizontally.
repeat-y: The image is repeated only vertically.
no-repeat: The image is not repeated at all.

Example:

body {
  background-image: url('image.png');
  background-repeat: repeat-x;
}
