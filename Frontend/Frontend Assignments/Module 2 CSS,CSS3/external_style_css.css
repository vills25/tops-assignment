/* What are the external style sheets?

they are CSS files that are linked to an HTML document to control the layout and appearance of the webpage. They contain style rules that 
define how HTML elements should be displayed, such as font sizes, colors, margins, and positioning. External style sheets are linked to the 
HTML document using the <link> tag in the <head> section of the HTML code.

Example:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
</body>
</html>
