Q.1 What is JavaScript?
   JavaScript is a high-level programming language commonly used for web development. It enables interactive web pages and is an essential 
   part of web applications. JavaScript code can be embedded directly into HTML pages and executed by web browsers. To use JavaScript, 
   you can include it within <script> tags in an HTML document or link to an external JavaScript file using the <script> tag's src 
   attribute.
   Example:
   
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
      <title>Document</title>
   </head>
   <body>
      <script>
      alert("Hello World!");
      </script>
   </body>
   </html>
