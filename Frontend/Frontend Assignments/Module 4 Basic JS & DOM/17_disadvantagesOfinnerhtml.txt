17. What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript?

Security Risks: Using innerHTML can expose your site to XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks if user input is inserted directly into the
                innerHTML property without proper sanitization.

Performance:    When using innerHTML, the entire content of the element is replaced, which can be inefficient for large HTML content 
                or frequent updates.
No Event Handlers: If you replace HTML content with innerHTML, any event handlers associated with the replaced elements will be lost.
