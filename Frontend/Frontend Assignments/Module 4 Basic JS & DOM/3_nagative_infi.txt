3. What is negative Infinity?

Negative Infinity is a special value in JavaScript that represents a value lower than any other number. 
It is the result of dividing a negative number by zero, or by evaluating an expression that yields a very large negative number.

console.log(Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY);  // -Infinity
