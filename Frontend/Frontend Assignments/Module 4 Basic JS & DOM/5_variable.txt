5. What are undeclared and undefined variables?

Undeclared Variables: These are variables that have been used in code without being declared with the var, let, or const keywords. 
                      Using them can cause errors in strict mode.
                      
Undefined Variables: These are variables that have been declared but have not been assigned a value. They default to undefined.
