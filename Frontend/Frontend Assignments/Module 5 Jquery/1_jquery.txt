1. What is jQuery?

jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It simplifies things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, 
event handling, animation, and Ajax with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. jQuery takes common tasks that 
require many lines of JavaScript code and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.
