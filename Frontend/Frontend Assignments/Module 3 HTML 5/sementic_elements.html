3. Semantic Elements in HTML5
Semantic elements clearly describe their meaning to both the browser and the developer. Some key semantic elements introduced in HTML5 
include:

<header>: Represents introductory content or a group of navigational links.
<nav>: Used for navigation sections like menus or tables of contents.
<main>: The main content area of a document, unique and central to the document’s purpose.
<article>: Contains independent, self-contained content that could be distributed separately.
<section>: Groups related content, typically with a heading.
<aside>: Contains content indirectly related to the main content, like sidebars.
<footer>: Represents the footer of a section or page.
<figure> and <figcaption>: Together, they’re used to group media content like images and provide captions.
