<!-- 4. Canvas and SVG Tags

Canvas:
The <canvas> element is used to draw graphics, like shapes, images, and text, using JavaScript. It’s a pixel-based drawing area, meaning it’s great for dynamic, script-driven graphics but doesn’t scale well like SVG.

Example of using the <canvas> tag: -->

<canvas id="myCanvas" width="500" height="400"></canvas>

<script>
  let canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
  let ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
  ctx.fillStyle = "blue";
  ctx.fillRect(20, 20, 150, 100);
</script>

<!-- SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics):
The <svg> tag is used to create vector-based graphics directly in the HTML. Unlike <canvas>, SVG graphics are scalable and don’t lose quality when resized.

Example of using the <svg> tag: -->

<svg width="100" height="100">
  <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="black" stroke-width="3" fill="red" />
</svg>

<!-- Scalable: SVG images are resolution-independent and can scale without losing quality.
Scriptable: You can manipulate SVG elements with JavaScript and CSS.

Both <canvas> and <svg> have their use cases: <canvas> is suitable for complex, dynamic, or animated graphics, while <svg> is better
for static, scalable graphics. -->
